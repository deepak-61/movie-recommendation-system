## Introduction
This project implements a Movie Recommender System using the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset. The goal of the recommender system is to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. By leveraging advanced algorithms, we aim to provide personalized movie recommendations that enhance user experience.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from TMDB and includes detailed information about movies, such as:
- Movie titles
- Genres
- Ratings
- Release dates
- User reviews

The dataset can be downloaded from [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

## Features
- Personalized movie recommendations based on user input.
- User-friendly interface for searching and browsing movies.
- Ability to filter recommendations by genre, rating, and release date.
- Visualization of recommendations over time.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender-system-tmdb-dataset.git
   cd movie-recommender-system-tmdb-dataset
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up TMDB API key by creating an `.env` file:
   ```
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage
To run the recommender system, execute the following command:
```
python app.py
```

After starting the application, navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to access the interface.

## Algorithm
This recommender system is built using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. The main algorithms used include:

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses user ratings and viewing history to suggest movies that similar users enjoyed.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Analyzes the features of movies (e.g., genre, director, actors) to recommend similar films.

Hybrid approaches combining both methods are also implemented to improve recommendation accuracy.

## Results
The recommender system has been evaluated based on feedback and accuracy metrics. Initial tests show an increase in user satisfaction and engagement levels. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the `results/` directory.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of machine learning models for enhanced accuracy.
- Implementing user clustering for better segmentation.
- Expansion of the dataset to include more recent movies and user data.
- Developing a mobile application for wider accessibility.
